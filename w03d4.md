## W03 D4

Consider an 8-bit universal binary counter supporting an asynchronous reset input plus four synchronous inputs to clear the outputs, to enable the operation of the counter, to load an 8-bit initial count value (c_in(7:0)), and to define the counting direction (up / down).


### 1.
Use the template below to create a function table describing the operation of this circuit.


### 2.
Create a VHDL design file complying with the functional requirements presented in the previous table.

### 3.
Prove the correctness of your design by simulation in Vivado.

### 4.
How would you change the function table and design file if you wanted to change the relative priority of the clear and load inputs?
